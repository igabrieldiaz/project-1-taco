            <h1>CARNITAS</h1>
            <p>My favorite kind of taco growing up was always the Carnitas taco. I did have other tacos, but at any given sitting, two-thirds of the tacos I consumed were Carnitas. There was something about that slow-cooked pork that, once served, was impossible for me to only have one. Now that I’ve gotten older, Carnitas are still amongst some of my favorite to have. Carnitas tacos can be dated back nearly 500 years in central Mexico. However, the state responsible for making the Carnitas taco really take off and develop it to what we know today is Michoacán. Carnitas are made by braising or simmering pork in oil or preferably lard until tender. The process takes three to four hours, and the result is very tender and juicy meat.</p>
