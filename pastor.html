            <h1>PASTOR</h1>
            <p>With roots that trace back to asian cuisine that immigrated to Mexico, Pastor tacos have quickly become not only one of Mexico’s favorite taco, but the entire worlds. Known for offering the unique blend of sweet and savory flavors, Pastor is one the main reasons the street taco culture has taken off in popularity all over the globe. The story behind the Pastor taco goes; during the 18 hundreds, immigrants from Lebanon made their way to Mexico where they introduced their shawarma or their version of grilling meat vertically shaped like a cone. In the new country, pork was substituted in for the lamb and it became uniquely Mexican. Now that cone is refered to as a “Trompo”. Trompos are usually seen outside on the sidewalks of streets, served directly to customers that are usually standing only a couple of feet away.</p>
